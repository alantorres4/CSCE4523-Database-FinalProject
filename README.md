# CSCE4523-Database-FinalProject
The goal of this project is to practice creating a database backend with a web front end using any technologies we preferred.
The project is currently hosted on an Apache server that the University of Arkansas Computer Science and Computer Engineering Department host. 
This project uses PHP files in cooperation with running commands on terminal using Python3. Those commands go through the backend logic to see what MySQL queries need to be used. Then those query results are output on the website and organized using tabulate.
